### Profile 

  I am an autodidact and an incessant neophile with a classical streak. I grew up watching my father paint in his art studio, and wrote my first application on an Apple IIgs.

### Skill Sets 

* Interface Design – Interactive and web
  
  Wireframing and comping with the user's best interests in mind. I focus on intuitive interaction with an emphasis on subtlty and usability rather than glitz and novelty. 

* Development – Desktop, web and mobile  
  
  Device agnosticism is a tenant i strongly champion, not in product, but rather in development. I succumb to no tool worship, my focus and energy is always on the finished product and getting there as cleanly as possible using the tools best suited for the job. 

* Research and Evangelism  
  
  While maintaining reverence for tried and true systems, I endlessly search for, explore and test new tool sets in order to lessen the gap between device and user.
