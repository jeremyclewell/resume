### Profile 

  I am an autodidact and an incessant neophile with a classical streak. I grew up watching my father paint in his art studio, and wrote my first small applications in Applesoft Basic on a IIgs. I strive to place myself in an environment that will both humble and inspire me.

### Skill Sets 

* Interface Design – Interactive and web
  
  Wireframing and comping with the user's best interests in mind. I focus on intuitive interaction with an emphasis on subtlty and usability rather than glitz and novelty. 

* Development – Desktop, web and mobile  
  
  Device agnosticism is a tenant I strongly champion, not in product, but rather in development. My focus is always on the finished product and getting there as cleanly as possible using the tools best suited for the job. 

* Research and Evangelism  
  
  While maintaining reverence for tried and true systems, I endlessly search for, explore and test new tool sets in order to lessen the gap between device and user.
